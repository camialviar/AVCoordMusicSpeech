# AVCoordMusicSpeech
This repository contains the datasets and code scripts for the paper "Multimodal Coordination of Sound and Movement in Solo Music and Speech" by Alviar, Dale, Dewitt, and Kello.
The Code Scripts folder contains the Matlab scripts for extracting the data and the R script for analysing the data. 
The Datasets folder contains two files: (a) the dataset with all the data from the spectral analysis that was done in Matlab, and it will allow you to replicate the spectral matching analysis in the R script. (b) A folder with the filtered sound and movement signals. It will allow you to replicate the cross-correlation results.
